The idea is to create an assistive android and web based platform for early diagnosis of severe yet curable diseases.
We implemented the above idea for the following diseases:

- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Brain Tumor
- Skin Cancer

With the service we are providing you, days of diagnosis are reduce to few seconds. The idea is discussed in detain in the presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V0waZhdmw_7hfcNVcK-9XRqD7yzbMR3k?usp=sharing). (explanation also available)
